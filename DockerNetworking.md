## 1. IP Address
An **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)** is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network. It identifies the device and allows it to communicate over the internet or local network.

---

## 2. Ethernet Cable
An **Ethernet Cable** is a physical networking cable used to connect devices (like computers, routers, switches) in a wired local area network (LAN). It carries data in the form of electrical signals.

---

## 3. Ethernet Card
An **Ethernet Card** (also called Network Interface Card – NIC) is hardware installed in a computer or device that allows it to connect to a wired network using an Ethernet cable.

---

## 4. Switch
A **Switch** is a networking device that connects multiple devices in a LAN and forwards data only to the device that needs it. It works at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** of the OSI model.

---

## 5. ARP Protocol
**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** is used to map (resolve) an **IP address** to a device’s **MAC address** inside a local network.  
Example: When a device knows the IP of another device but not its MAC, it uses ARP to find it.

## 6. Gateway
A **Gateway** is a networking device (usually a router) that connects a local network to other networks or the internet. Devices send packets to the gateway when the destination is outside their local network.

---

## 7. Subnetting
**Subnetting** is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets). It improves performance, security, and efficient IP address usage.
